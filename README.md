## Overview
The Budget & Expense Tracker is a web application that helps users manage their expenses efficiently. Users can add expenses, categorize them, visualize data using charts, and convert currency for total spending.

## Features
- Add, categorize, and delete expenses
- Custom category input for expenses
- Interactive charts (Doughnut & Bar) for expense visualization
- Local storage support for expense persistence
- Currency conversion with live exchange rates
- Responsive and modern UI design

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the application
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and logic
- **Chart.js**: Graphical representation of expenses
- **Fetch API**: Currency conversion using external API

## Installation & Usage

### 2. Open the `index.html` File

## File Structure

2. Click "Add Expense" to log the expense
3. View expenses in a list and delete them if needed
4. Charts update dynamically based on expense data
5. Convert total spending into different currencies

## Currency Conversion
The app fetches live exchange rates from an external API to convert the total amount into different currencies.
